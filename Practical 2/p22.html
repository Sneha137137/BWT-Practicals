    <h2 align="left">Network</h2>
    <p align="left">
        Computer networking involves connecting multiple computing devices to enable communication and resource sharing. It allows devices like computers, servers, and printers to exchange data and work together. This is achieved through physical or wireless connections and standardized communication protocols .Here's a more detailed breakdown:
What it is:
Computer networking is the process of linking devices so they can exchange information and resources. 
It encompasses the design, construction, use, management, and maintenance of these interconnected systems. 
Networks can be wired (using cables) or wireless (using radio waves)

    <h1 align="center">About Computer</h1>
    <p align="center">A computer is a programmable electronic device that accepts data (input), processes it according to programmed instructions, and then produces results (output). It stores data and information for future use and can range from smartphones to high-end servers, combining hardware (physical components) and software (programs) to form a computer system. Modern computers are capable of a wide range of tasks, from complex calculations to browsing the internet and controlling other devices. 
Key Functions
A computer performs four fundamental functions: 
Input: It takes in raw data through devices like keyboards or sensors. 
Processing: The Central Processing Unit (CPU) manipulates the data by following the instructions in software programs. 
Output: It presents the processed data or information in a human-readable format on devices like screens or printers. 
Storage: Data and programs are saved on storage devices for later use.

    <h3 align="right">Software</h3>
    <p align="right" >Software is a collection of computer programs, data, and instructions that tell a computer or device how to perform specific tasks, making it the intangible, non-physical component of any digital system. It enables users to interact with devices, such as creating graphics, editing videos, and managing information, without needing to understand the underlying hardware. Software is categorized into three main types: System Software, which manages the computer's resources (e.g., operating systems); Application Software, which performs specific user tasks (e.g., word processors); and Programming Software, which helps developers create other software.</p>
